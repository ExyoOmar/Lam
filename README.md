# 🧠 Lam — The Ultra-Intelligent Frontend PC Diagnostic Tool

**Lam** is a one-of-a-kind, question-focused, browser-based diagnostic system that thinks, reasons, and evolves like a top-tier systems engineer. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no backend, no external APIs — **Lam** simulates human-like troubleshooting intelligence to deliver **highly probable, explainable PC problem diagnoses**.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 Cognitive Diagnostic Engine (CDE)
A core module that simulates metacognitive problem-solving:
- Adaptive questioning using **Bayesian inference** and **fuzzy logic**
- Confidence scoring that updates in real time
- Multisymptom correlation (e.g., “freezes + noises + Event ID 51”)

---

### 🧬 Persona-Based Diagnostic Modes
Switch between expert personas for domain-specific insight:
- **Hardware Hermit** – Power, thermal, and physical-level faults  
- **OS Oracle** – Deep system internals, drivers, event logs  
- **Network Ninja** – IP stack failures, DNS, adapter issues  
- **Forensics Falcon** – Malware, behavioral anomalies, stealth issues

Each persona customizes the diagnostic path, questioning tone, and logic hierarchy.

---

### 📊 Diagnostic Storyline UI
A unique interface inspired by crime-solving timelines:
- Live-updating diagnosis probability graphs  
- Breadcrumb trail of user responses and Lam’s interpretations  
- “What If” simulation mode for alternate scenario modeling  
- Visual explanation of every decision and next step

---

### 🤖 Humanlike Interaction & Socratic Reasoning
- Clarifying sub-questions based on ambiguity detection  
- Emotion-aware UI cues (frustration, urgency, confusion)  
- Natural language pattern recognition (e.g., “it acts weird when I open Chrome”)  
- Deep transparency: ask Lam “Why this question?” at any point

---

### ⚙️ Offline-First Architecture (PWA)
Lam runs **100% client-side**:
- Fully functional offline as a Progressive Web App  
- Uses Service Workers to cache diagnostic models and UI assets  
- LocalStorage saves session history, user decisions, and confidence shifts  
- Sessions exportable as JSON or PDF for technicians

---

### 🧠 Intelligence Meta-Mode (Optional)
Peek inside Lam’s “mind”:
- Real-time logic tree with weighted decisions  
- Confidence heatmap of possible issues  
- Internal monologue simulator (“Based on the PSU age and error timeline…”)  
- Self-corrective reasoning: changes path if assumptions fail

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Clean semantic structure  
- **TailwindCSS** — Apple-level minimalist UI/UX  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** — Modular expert systems, decision trees, and inference logic  
- **JSON** — Diagnostic knowledge base, persona modules, and logic graphs  
- **Service Workers** — Full offline PWA support  
- **LocalStorage** — State persistence and historical analysis  

---

## 📦 Coming Soon

- 🔌 Plugin system to add community-made diagnosis modules  
- 🌐 RTL interface support for Arabic and other languages  
- 🔍 Smart scanner (experimental): real-time system feedback parser using Web APIs  
- 🧠 Learn Mode: teaches users basic troubleshooting as they answer questions
